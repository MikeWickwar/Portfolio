      Duende Identity Server is a powerful identity management platform designed to enhance security and authentication processes. It provides scalable identity services, ensuring robust access management across multiple applications. As part of the Identity Platform team, I played a key role in implementing and managing identity solutions using technologies like .NET Core, C#, Duende Identity Server, Webpack, JavaScript, SCSS, Docker, and SQL. I focused on integrating these solutions seamlessly to meet the security and scalability needs of our projects.
