      The Marching Band Drill Writing App automates the creation of drill formations for marching bands,
      ensuring precise placement of band members on a field grid. Drill writing involves mapping intricate
      movements that synchronize with music, requiring meticulous attention to detail and accuracy. This project
      is based on a grid system that overlays the standard football field where it will take 8 22.5-inch steps
      to go 5 yards.
